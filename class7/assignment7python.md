# Class 7: Visualizing data

# In Class:
Together work through the intro and the first 12 steps in the first module, Basic Concepts (through "Using an Editor") at [Sololearn](https://www.sololearn.com/Play/Python#)

This site works equally well on laptop and phone so you can make progress through the modules with a few minutes here and there.


# Assignment 7: 
Read through Albert Sanchez Lafuente's [Complete Guide to Data Visualization with Python](https://towardsdatascience.com/complete-guide-to-data-visualization-with-python-2dd74df12b5e) to undertand the various libraries available for doing data visualization in Python.

Take the Module 1 Quiz from Sololearn individually. Screenshot your results and save them to your GitHub page, submitting the link in Canvas.

Work on your final project.
