# Digital Frameworks Spring 2019

## Details

**Instructor**: Randy Leonard

**Contact**: Randall.Leonard@northwestern.edu OR on Slack

**Class time**: On Zoom 6-9 p.m., Tuesdays, April 7 to June 2

**Office hours**: By appointment

**Description**: Reporters find news every day by talking to people and unearthing their secrets. In this class, we're going to do the same — but with data. This is not a graphic design or programming class, but a course that will teach you the concepts behind data reporting, provide you a familiarity with various tools and give you some hands-on skills to help you use the huge number of datasets available to reporters in order to break news and help inform our readers through text and visuals. By the end of this course, you should be able to:

* Find datasets relevant to a story you're reporting
* Process and clean data
* Analyze and "interview" data to find a story within it
* Visualize and present a story based on data
* Speak the language of reporters and technologists who use data to tell stories
* Identify common problems with data and think critically about its use in news reporting

Much of this class (and its syllabus) is based on Medill courses by the same name taught by [Sean McMinn](https://github.com/shmcminn/digitalframeworks-spring19) of NPR and [Rachel Shorey](https://github.com/rshorey/digitalframeworks-spring18) from the New York Times.


## Policies

### Expectations

* Join the class sessions or let me know if you can't make it. I understand these are tough times and that situations may occur that make it difficult to attend, and I'm willing to help you if you get in touch with me. Either way, you will be responsible for the material unless otherwise agreed.
* Complete assignments either during the session time or as homework due before the next class. That means assignments are due at 6 p.m. on Tuesdays, unless otherwise stated.
   * Late assignments will only be accepted if you contact me **before** the class in which it was originally due and we reach an agreement. 
* Submit assignments on Github (instructions in first lecture) as specified in the assignment.
* Consume the news every week, and come to class with at least one story using data. I will randomly select several people to share a story at the beginning of class, so please have a link ready to go (and I will do the same). 
* Complete a final project, which will be a 1,000- to 1,350-word story with graphic proposals, based substantially on data. 
* I reserve the right to change this syllabus at any time, provided all changes are pushed to GitHub where you can track them in the "commits" section for this repository. If at any time you feel like a change I made isn't fair, you can tell me why and I'll reconsider it.


### Grading

Your grade will be made up of three components:

* 35%: Class attendance and participation, including presenting data stories when I call on you to do so
* 45%: Assignments
* 20%: Final project

#### Class and Assignment grading scale:
This quarter, courses including this one will be graded pass/fail **UNLESS** you opt out and chose the quality letter grade option in Caesar. You must activly make that change in Caesar if you want a letter grade.

Individual assinments will receive letter grades on the following scale:

* A: strong work which shows unique perspective and earnest effort, publishable with minimal edits. The kind of work from someone I'd recommend for a job or promotion.
* B: decent work, showing some effort or decent success, publishable with significant edits. The kind of work that would be considered getting by at a job.
* C: work that is wanting -- lacking effort or ingenuity and would need reporter’s revision to be published. This type of work does not lead to job security.
   * You can not get more than a C on an assignment if there are factual errors.
* D: unpublishable work, even with edits. This would be work that is clearly not prefessional caliber. 
* F: did not complete work as assigned



### Collaboration

Students are encouraged to discuss assignments. For the most part, you will be working on different things, so talking about your work should not be a problem. Whiteboarding your way through a sticky problem with a friend or looking online for answers to technical questions are encouraged (programmers do that all the time!). Your final work, however, must be entirely your own. A good rule of thumb is that no one else should take over your keyboard while completing an assignment.

Due by the second-to-last class (on June 2) will be a data-driven story of between 1,000 and 1,350 words. This should include at least two workable drafts for data visualizations and interviews with multiple sources. The graphics for this story should be integrated into the story's presentation — not separate pieces. Unless otherwise discussed, the "nut graf" of your story should be something you discovered using the data skills covered in this course. 

**Other issues with remote coursework**
Students are expected to log in at the appointed time from remote locations. Canvas and Zoom activities during the appointed class time will be part of your participation grade. That said, there may be a variety of reasons including illness, technical difficulties and time zone differences—that could hamper perfect attendance and require accommodations and alternative options. To mitigate difficulties, please adhere to the following practices:
•	Make sure your Canvas settings are set to YOUR time zone so that all prompts for class meetings will be accurate.
•	Please let me know via email before class begins if you are NOT in the CST, PST, Mountain or EST time zones.
•	If you are going to miss class for any reason, whenever possible communicate with me in advance of the scheduled class. If illness is a factor, please contact me and the Office of Student Life. 
•	If you are unable to participate because of technical issues, please reach out to me and the Office of Student Life as soon as possible. For help acquiring materials and other financial assistance, use this form: https://forms.apps.northwestern.edu/view.php?id=324808
•	For help with the wider range of issues including technology, housing, illness and travel, go here:  https://nuinfo-proto12.northwestern.edu/coronavirus-covid-19-updates/developments/updates/message-to-students.html 
•	Class group sessions generally will be recorded. If you miss class at our scheduled time, you will be expected to watch the class recording. Please bear in mind that these recordings will likely not fully replicate the experience of the conversation we have during class time. There may be required assignments noted in Canvas for students who miss class. These will not be onerous, but will serve to help you learn and practice skills learned during the class you missed.

 
**Recording Classes**
Unauthorized student recording of classroom or other academic activities (including advising sessions or office hours) is prohibited. Unauthorized recording is unethical and may also be a violation of University policy and state law. Students requesting the use of assistive technology as an accommodation should contact AccessibleNU. Unauthorized use of classroom recordings – including distributing or posting them – is also prohibited.  Under the University’s Copyright Policy, faculty own the copyright to instructional materials – including those resources created specifically for the purposes of instruction, such as syllabi, lectures and lecture notes, and presentations.  Students cannot copy, reproduce, display or distribute these materials. Students who engage in unauthorized recording, unauthorized use of a recording or unauthorized distribution of instructional materials will be referred to the appropriate University office for follow-up.
 
Portions of the Washington Reporting classes may be recorded. That will be announced in advance. These recordings will be shared only with students enrolled in the course and will be deleted at the end of the Spring Quarter. Your instructor will communicate how you can access the recordings.
 

**Academic Integrity**
All students are required to adhere to the Medill Integrity Code, as well as Northwestern University’s academic integrity policies. Academic dishonesty can result in penalties ranging from letters of warning to separation from the university. Your instructor may give a failing grade in this course for academic dishonesty. All student work in this class may be analyzed electronically for violations of the University's academic integrity policy and may also be included in a database for the purpose of testing for plagiarized content.


**Accessibility Statement**
Any student requesting accommodations related to a disability or other condition is required to register with AccessibleNU (accessiblenu@northwestern.edu; 847-467-5530) and provide professors with an accommodation notification from AccessibleNU, preferably within the first two weeks of class. All information will remain confidential.


**Inclusion Statement**
Medill is committed to creating an inclusive environment and to providing equity in opportunities. Medill is dedicated to creating a socially just community by fostering acceptance for a broad range of communities and concepts. We aim to welcome people from diverse backgrounds and support them so they may thrive in our community and beyond.


**Sexual Misconduct and Reporting**
Northwestern University is committed to fostering an environment where students are safe and free from sexual misconduct. Confidential resources are available to those who have experienced sexual misconduct. Faculty and instructors are not confidential resources and are required to report incidents of sexual misconduct, whether discussed in your assignments or in person, to the Title IX Coordinator, who can provide information about resources and options. I encourage students who have experienced sexual misconduct to talk with someone to get support. For more information, including how to request interim protective measures and academic accommodations or file a complaint, see the Get Help page.

**Discrimination and Sexual Harassment**
Northwestern University's Policies on Discrimination, Harassment, and Sexual Harassment apply to all members of the University community, including students, staff, and faculty. Any student, staff, or faculty member who believes that he or she has been discriminated against or harassed on the basis of his or her race, color, religion, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, parental status, marital status, age, disability, citizenship, veteran status, genetic information or any other classification protected by law, should contact the Office of Equal Opportunity and Access at (847) 491-7458 or the Sexual Harassment Prevention Office at (847) 467-6571. Additional information about the University's discrimination and harassment policies, including the campus resources available to assist individuals with discrimination or harassment concerns, is available online on the Human Resources Equal Opportunity and Access website.
