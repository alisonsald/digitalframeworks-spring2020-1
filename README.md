# Digital Frameworks Spring 2019

## Details

**Instructor**: Randy Leonard

**Contact**: Randall.Leonard@northwestern.edu OR on Slack

**Class time**: 6-9 p.m., Tuesdays, April 7 to June 2

**Office hours**: By appointment

**Description**: Reporters find news every day by talking to people and unearthing their secrets. In this class, we're going to do the same — but with data. This is not a graphic design or programming class, but a course that will teach you the concepts behind data reporting, provide you a familiarity with various tools and give you some hands-on skills to help you use the huge number of datasets available to reporters in order to break news and help inform our readers through text and visuals. By the end of this course, you should be able to:

* Find datasets relevant to a story you're reporting
* Process and clean data
* Analyze and "interview" data to find a story within it
* Visualize and present a story based on data
* Speak the language of reporters and technologists who use data to tell stories
* Identify common problems with data and think critically about its use in news reporting

Much of this class (and its syllabus) is based on Medill courses by the same name taught by [Sean McMinn](https://github.com/shmcminn/digitalframeworks-spring19)of NPR and [Rachel Shorey](https://github.com/rshorey/digitalframeworks-spring18) from the New York Times.


## Policies

### Expectations

* Join the class sessions or let me know if you can't make it. I understand these are tought times and that situations may occur that make it difficult to attend, and I'm willing to help you if you get in touch with me. Either way, you will be responsible for the material unless otherwise agreed.
* Complete assignments either during the session time or as homework due before the next class. That means assignments are due at 6 p.m. on Tuesdays, unless otherwise stated.
   * Late assignments will only be accepted if you contact me **before** the class in which it was originally due and we reach an agreement. 
* Submit assignments on Github (instructions in first lecture) as specified in the assignment.
* Consume the news every week, and come to class with at least one story using data. I will randomly select several people to share a story at the beginning of class, so please have a link ready to go (and I will do the same). 
* Complete a final project, which will be a 1,000- to 1,350-word story with graphic proposals, based substantially on data. 
* I reserve the right to change this syllabus at any time, provided all changes are pushed to GitHub where you can track them in the "commits" section for this repository. If at any time you feel like a change I made isn't fair, you can tell me why and I'll reconsider it.


### Grading

Your grade will be made up of three components:

* 35%: Class attendance and participation, including presenting data stories when I call on you to do so
* 45%: Assignments
* 20%: Final project

#### Assignment grading scale:
* A: strong work which shows unique perspective and earnest effort, publishable with minimal edits. The kind of work from someone I'd recommend for a job or promotion.
* B: decent work, showing some effort or decent success, publishable with significant edits. The kind of work that would be considered getting by at a job.
* C: work that is wanting -- lacking effort or ingenuity and would need reporter’s revision to be published. This type of work does not lead to job security.
   * You can not get more than a C on an assignment if there are factual errors.
* D: unpublishable work, even with edits. This would be work that is clearly not prefessional caliber. 
* F: did not complete work as assigned



### Collaboration

Students are encouraged to discuss assignments. For the most part, you will be working on different things, so talking about your work should not be a problem. Whiteboarding your way through a sticky problem with a friend or looking online for answers to technical questions are encouraged (programmers do that all the time!). Your final work, however, must be entirely your own. A good rule of thumb is that no one else should take over your keyboard while completing an assignment.

### [Final project](finalproject.md)

Due by the second-to-last class (on June 11) will be a data-driven story of between 1,000 and 1,350 words. This should include at least two proposals for data visualizations and interviews with multiple sources. The graphics for this story should be integrated into the story's presentation — not separate pieces. Unless otherwise discussed, the "nut graf" of your story should be something you discovered using the data skills covered in this course.
