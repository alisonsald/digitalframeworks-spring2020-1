In four months, Mike Bloomberg raised 137,000 in individual contributions, despite his presidential campaign claiming not to accept donations. His top five contributors were an interior designer, and four people in research and technology but there were also realtors and psychologists, and people working in data visualization who contributed to his campaign. 
I found data on individual contributions to Mike Bloomberg’s campaign on the FEC website starting from November 29, 2019, a few days after he announced he would run for the Democratic nomination. These ended on February 26, 2020, a week before he pulled out of the race. 

To follow up on this story, I would compare this to how much other candidates raised in the same time, and also look at what were the other sources of financing for the Democratic presidential nomination race. I also would interview some of the few individuals who donated to Bloomberg to see what prompted them to contribute to the billionaire’s campaign when he said he doesn’t need help. I would also like to see who do they now support and do they continue to contribute to political campaigns?  This story would likely take four days to report.
In order to find my story, I did the following:
Searched the FEC website for individual contributions to presidential candidates and found data on contributions to Mike Bloomberg 2020, Inc. and exported a CSV file. 
Sorted the contributions from highest to lowest to identify his major contributors. Also ran a pivot table to see which groups of professionals are drawn to him most. 
Repeated the previous step for the locations of these contributors
I also took the sum of the contribution_receipt_amount column and ran a pivot table on the donors to find out how many were individual contributions and where they were located. 

Headline: Mike Bloomberg’s self-funded 2020 presidential bid raised $137,000 in donations over four months

Nut graf: Contrary to popular belief, former presidential candidate Mike Bloomberg, who is known to have run the shortest race for the Democrat nomination through a self-funded campaign, actually raised over  $137,000 in individual contributions in four months. While most of his supporters hailed from New York, the former NYC mayor’s homeground, many contributions were made to the former republican from Florida, New Jersey and Connecticut. 
His top five contributors were an interior designer, and four people in research and technology. Other supporters included realtors, psychologists, and data visualizers.
