# In class:

Together work through the next six D3 exercises in freeCodeCamp:
* Update the Height of an Element Dynamically
* Change the Presentation of a Bar Chart
* Learn About SVG in D3
* Display Shapes with SVG
* Create a Bar for Each Data Point in the Set
* Dynamically Set the Coordinates for Each Bar

# Assignment 4: Story Pitch

Develop and write out your final story pitch. 

As part of your pitch, please include the following:

1. What data source(s) you plan on using (though you can always add more later)
2. Some sources you can talk to about the data or to get anecdotes from it
3. What elements in the data might be good candidates to visualize
4. What your news hook is - why is this timely?
5. What question will you answer with your data, and _why_ is it newsworthy?

Feel free to reach out to me anytime about any questions or thoughts before submitting the written pitch on Github, which should be done by the beginning of next class.

### Example from previous years 

I plan to analyze the amount of time it's taken for Supreme Court justices to be confirmed by the United States Senate. What I want to find is if the party in control of the Senate is different the president's party, does it take longer for justices to be confirmed? I'm also interested in times nominations appeared to be contentious even when the Senate aligned with the president's party.

To do this, I will use data on confirmation and nomination dates from the U.S. Supreme Court, as well as historical party data from the Senate and United States Presidency Project.

I could visualize the length of nomination fights. I could also visualize the number of justices each president nominated and how many were confirmed.

This is timely because of the upcoming fight over Brett Kavanaugh, who President Donald Trump recently nominated to the court.

For sources, I could talk to former Senate or White House aides who have worked on Supreme Court nominations. I could also talk to experts, potentially at universities, who study the relationship between the different branches of government.
